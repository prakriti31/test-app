# Katalyst â€” Meeting Viewer (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

## What this is
A small React app that demonstrates:
- Fetching meetings via a single "MCP/Composio" integration point (mocked).
- Displaying 5 upcoming and 5 past meetings.
- Basic UI with Tailwind CSS.
- Mock AI summaries for past meetings.

This repo is purposely scoped to be completed in ~5 hours:
- Core: UI + mock MCP integration + loading/error states.
- Bonus: Replace mock summarizer with OpenAI serverless summarizer.

## Quick start

1. Install
```bash
npm install
